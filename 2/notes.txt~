2.4 Class Definition

To design an object we need to answer five basic questions:
  -> What role will the object perform in the program?
  -> What data or information will it need?
  -> What actions will it take?
  -> What interface will it present to other objects?
  -> What information will it hide from other objects?

Refer to the Riddle class in riddleProgram.

2.4.4 EFFECTIVE DESIGN: Public Methods

The public methods and variales make up an objects interface.
  Public methods can be used and accessed by other objects.



-----
2.4.2 The RiddleUser Class

We seperate the main() method and the Riddle class
  to get into the habit of placing a distinction between
    the user interface(RiddleUser) and computational object(Riddle).

2.4.5 Define, Create, Use

Writing a Java program is a matter of three basic steps:
  -> Class Definition
       Define one or more classes.
  -> Object Instantiation
       Create objects and instances of the classes.
  -> Object Use
       Use the objects to do tasks.
