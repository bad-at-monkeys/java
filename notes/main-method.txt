THE MAIN METHOD

The main() method is the front door or entry point to our program.

public class Addition {
    
    public static int addTwo(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(addTwo(2, 4));
    }
}


There are correct ways to write the main() method:
  -> It must be public static or static public for the modifiers
  -> The return type must be void
  -> The method name must be 'main'
  -> It must accept an array of Strings (Strings[] args) or {String args[])
