COMPILATION AND EXECUTION

We run the program through javac to first compile it:
$ javac HelloWorld.java

We get a class file out of it.
$ ls
HelloWorld.class    HelloWorld.java

The class file can be distributed to other machines to compile a .java file.

Now run the program with java and it prints to STDOUT:
$ cd ..
$ java topicsAssessed.HelloWorld
Hello World


The source is HelloWorld.java,
once compiled into bytecode it becomes HelloWorld.class
